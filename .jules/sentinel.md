## 2026-08-10 - SSRF via Open Redirects in Invoice PDFs
**Vulnerability:** In `apps.orders.views`, when fetching remote Cloudinary PDF files, the `requests.get` call lacked `allow_redirects=False`. This allowed an attacker to upload an image to Cloudinary that returned a 302 redirect pointing to internal services (e.g., `169.254.169.254`), bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check.
**Learning:** Checking the domain of a URL via `urlparse` before fetching it is insufficient if the HTTP client follows redirects by default. The attacker can host a payload on an allowed domain that redirects to a protected internal resource.
**Prevention:** Always pass `allow_redirects=False` to `requests.get` when fetching external user-supplied or partially-user-controlled URLs.

## 2026-08-10 - IP Spoofing in Admin Log Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `Pm2LogsView` manually parsed `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` using `x_forwarded_for.split(',')[0].strip()` (the left-most IP), allowing any client to bypass the `LOGS_ALLOWED_IPS` list by simply injecting a spoofed internal IP in the header.
**Learning:** Trusting the left-most IP in `X-Forwarded-For` is fundamentally insecure as it is entirely client-controlled.
**Prevention:** Always use the centralized `get_client_ip` function in `apps.accounts.security` to extract the client IP, which correctly uses `X-Real-IP` or the right-most (proxy-appended) IP from `X-Forwarded-For`.

## 2024-05-18 - [Fix XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML in Next.js SSR]
**Vulnerability:** User-generated blog content was injected directly into the DOM using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `frontend/src/app/(store)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` without sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
**Learning:** This codebase uses Next.js server-side rendering (SSR). Standard `dompurify` cannot be used as it fails during SSR due to missing browser APIs (like `window`). A specific library, `isomorphic-dompurify`, must be used to ensure sanitization works both on the server and the client.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: ... }}` with `DOMPurify.sanitize()` from `isomorphic-dompurify`, especially when rendering potentially untrusted user content like blog markdown.
## 2024-06-18 - Prevent SSRF in Admin Image Downloading
**Vulnerability:** Admin serializers (`AdminCategorySerializer`, `AdminProductSerializer`) used `requests.get` to download user-supplied image URLs without validating the scheme or hostname, exposing the application to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
**Learning:** The architecture allows administrators to provide external URLs for images, which are then fetched by the backend. Without strict validation, an attacker could force the server to make requests to internal services or malicious endpoints.
**Prevention:** Always validate the URL scheme (e.g., `https`) and ensure the hostname is within a strict allowlist (e.g., `res.cloudinary.com`) before making outbound HTTP requests using `requests.get`.
