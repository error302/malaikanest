## 2026-08-10 - SSRF via Open Redirects in Invoice PDFs
**Vulnerability:** In `apps.orders.views`, when fetching remote Cloudinary PDF files, the `requests.get` call lacked `allow_redirects=False`. This allowed an attacker to upload an image to Cloudinary that returned a 302 redirect pointing to internal services (e.g., `169.254.169.254`), bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check.
**Learning:** Checking the domain of a URL via `urlparse` before fetching it is insufficient if the HTTP client follows redirects by default. The attacker can host a payload on an allowed domain that redirects to a protected internal resource.
**Prevention:** Always pass `allow_redirects=False` to `requests.get` when fetching external user-supplied or partially-user-controlled URLs.

## 2026-08-10 - IP Spoofing in Admin Log Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `Pm2LogsView` manually parsed `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` using `x_forwarded_for.split(',')[0].strip()` (the left-most IP), allowing any client to bypass the `LOGS_ALLOWED_IPS` list by simply injecting a spoofed internal IP in the header.
**Learning:** Trusting the left-most IP in `X-Forwarded-For` is fundamentally insecure as it is entirely client-controlled.
**Prevention:** Always use the centralized `get_client_ip` function in `apps.accounts.security` to extract the client IP, which correctly uses `X-Real-IP` or the right-most (proxy-appended) IP from `X-Forwarded-For`.

## 2024-05-18 - [Fix XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML in Next.js SSR]
**Vulnerability:** User-generated blog content was injected directly into the DOM using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `frontend/src/app/(store)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` without sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
**Learning:** This codebase uses Next.js server-side rendering (SSR). Standard `dompurify` cannot be used as it fails during SSR due to missing browser APIs (like `window`). A specific library, `isomorphic-dompurify`, must be used to ensure sanitization works both on the server and the client.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: ... }}` with `DOMPurify.sanitize()` from `isomorphic-dompurify`, especially when rendering potentially untrusted user content like blog markdown.

## 2026-08-10 - SSRF via External Image Fetch in Admin Products
**Vulnerability:** In `apps.products.admin_serializers`, when downloading image URLs provided by the admin, the `requests.get` call lacked validation of the domain and URL scheme, and allowed redirects. This allowed a compromised or malicious admin account to fetch internal network resources via SSRF.
**Learning:** Admin endpoints providing "download from URL" features need strict validation, even if they are authenticated endpoints, to protect the internal network. We cannot rely solely on the fact that only trusted admins can reach this code.
**Prevention:** Always validate that the scheme is `https`, verify the hostname against a strict allowlist (like `settings.INVOICE_URL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` or a dedicated list for image URLs), and pass `allow_redirects=False` to `requests.get` to prevent open-redirect-based bypasses.
